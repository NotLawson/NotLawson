üëãHello, dear reader.

Welcome to my humble abode.

## README.md

I am currently a highschool student down under, and have a few of my school projects up here, such as my [Chess Robot](https://github.com/NotLawson/STEM_Chess_Robot), an [absentee app using facial recognition](https://github.com/NotLawson/absentee_app), my ([winning!!](https://education.qld.gov.au/about-us/events-awards/awards-competitions/premiers-coding-challenge/winning-entries#:~:text=Individual%20category-,Lawson,-%2C%20West%20Moreton%20Anglican) üèÜ) entry to the [Premier's Coding Challenge](https://github.com/NotLawson/premierscodingchallenge), or just other [school projects](https://github.com/NotLawson/digitaltechnology) that aren't worthy of thier own repo.

I don't just focus on school however; I <b><i>love</b></i> to play Helldivers 2 and Rocket League, winning our interschool esport tournament for the latter. I know my way around a motherboard, dabble with electronics and obsess over home automation.

I also play basketball, and am pretty good at it if I do say so myself. I mean, it doesn't hurt that I'm 6ft2 üôÉ
